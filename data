As the tournament progresses, both teams are poised to deliver a captivating performance.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Rajasthan Royals are riding high, leading the points table with eight wins from nine matches. A victory in this upcoming game would clinch their playoff berth, a testament to their dominant run this season. The team&#39;s success has been significantly aided by the stellar performance of their top four batters, who have consistently made valuable contributions. Additionally, their bowling attack has been formidable, with Yuzvendra Chahal reaching a personal milestone of 200 IPL wickets, underscoring the strength of RR&#39;s bowling lineup. With high confidence and momentum on their side, the Royals are looking to extend their winning streak.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>On the other side, Sunrisers Hyderabad has shown impressive batting prowess throughout the season, marked by aggressive power hitting from the top and middle order. For the first time, they have surpassed 100 sixes in the IPL, with Abhishek Sharma, Travis Head, and Heinrich Klaasen leading the charge. However, after a strong start to the season, two consecutive losses have slightly derailed their campaign, placing them in fifth position with 10 points. With their playoff hopes at stake, the Sunrisers need to quickly move past their recent setbacks and regroup. T Natarajan has been a crucial part of their bowling unit, consistently delivering performances that bolster the team&#39;s chances.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As these two teams clash, Sunrisers Hyderabad aims to revive their campaign and push for a playoff spot, while Rajasthan Royals look to secure their position and continue their formidable form.

Both teams have secured five wins each, though Delhi has played two more games than Kolkata. The Knight Riders come into this match after enduring one of the most dramatic finishes in IPL history, having conceded a record chase of 262 to Punjab Kings on their home ground. Recent matches at Eden Gardens have consistently seen high scores, with two successful chases over 220 and a narrow miss, indicating a trend of high-scoring games this season. So far, scores over 200 have been recorded 29 times in 46 matches, with 18 resulting in wins.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Despite being strong on paper, KKR&#39;s bowling has faltered, contributing to two losses in their last three games. They aim to address these shortcomings as they seek to regain their winning form. Positioned second in the standings, Kolkata&#39;s openers, Phil Salt and Sunil Narine, have consistently given them strong starts.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Delhi Capitals, meanwhile, enter this game following a close 10-run win against Mumbai Indians, where they posted a formidable 257. The team has relied heavily on the scoring prowess of Rishabh Pant, Tristan Stubbs, and Jake Fraser-McGurk, with Fraser impressing with his aggressive starts. Pant, Stubbs, and Axar Patel have been crucial in the middle and death overs, contributing significantly. Delhi hopes to extend their winning streak, backed by Kuldeep Yadav and Khaleel Ahmed, who have each taken 12 wickets, bolstering their bowling attack.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>As both teams prepare for this crucial encounter, the focus will be on adjusting strategies to exploit the high-scoring conditions at Eden Gardens, with KKR aiming to stabilize their campaign and Delhi looking to climb higher in the standings.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Head-To-Head in IPL:<\/strong><br \/>\nIn the 32 games contested between the two teams, KKR have an upper-hand with 17 wins to DC&#39;s 15.<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Head to Head - 640 (14)_1714393402.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Records Galore in IPL 2024:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>1 - First instance of four openers scoring 50 or more in an IPL game (KKR vs PBKS).<br \/>\n4 - Number of times the match aggregates have crossed 500 in T20s in 2024, most in a calendar year in T20s surpassing the record set in 2023 with 3<br \/>\n8 - Totals of 250 or more have been scored eight times in this IPL Season.<br \/>\n9 - Hundreds scored by opening batters in IPL 2024, the most in a season.Previously eight centuries were scored by openers in 2023 season.<br \/>\n42 - Number of sixes smashed in KKR vs PBKS game, the most in a single T20 match.<br \/>\n262 - Highest IPL total in a losing cause scored by RCB against SRH.<br \/>\n287 - Highest total in IPL in winning cause scored by SRH against RCB.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert:<\/strong><br \/>\n<strong>2 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Venkatesh Iyer<\/span> (48) needs two sixes to complete 50 IPL Sixes.<br \/>\n3 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Axar Patel<\/span> (97) needs three fours to complete 100 fours in IPL.<br \/>\n6 - <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer<\/span> (2994) needs six runs to complete 3000 runs in IPL.<br \/>\n6 -&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Rinku Singh<\/span> (44) needs six sixes to complete 50 sixes&nbsp;<br \/>\n17 - <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shai Hope<\/span> (2483) needs 17 runs to complete 3000 runs in T20s.<br \/>\n97 - <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Sunil Narine<\/span> (1403) needs 97 runs to complete 1500 runs in IPL.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>VENUE STATS:<br \/>\nT20s AT KOLKATA IN IPL 2024:&nbsp;<br \/>\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/> FIRST: 2<br \/>\nWON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;SECOND : 3<br \/>\nAVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 215<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#330000\"><strong>PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<br \/>\nDarren Ganga &amp; Simon Katich: &quot; 59 &amp; 71 meters are the square boundaries.

Both teams are struggling in the lower half of the points table, with the visitors currently at the bottom. Royal Challengers Bangalore come into this match with a bit of momentum, having secured a win against Sunrisers Hyderabad in their last outing, breaking a streak of six consecutive losses. They are keen to build on this recent success, especially with their bowling unit showing significant improvement.<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other side, the Gujarat Titans are looking to recover from a narrow defeat against Delhi Capitals, where they lost by just four runs while chasing a formidable target of 225. A major concern for the Titans has been the lackluster performance of their middle order, which has contributed the least runs in the league so far this season. The team urgently needs these key players to step up if they are to compete effectively and return to winning ways. As both teams face off, Gujarat aims to leverage home advantage to overcome their challenges, while Bangalore looks to continue their revival in form.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Head-To-Head In IPL:<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Head to Head - 640 (15)_1714293412.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Potential Contenders for T20 World Cup:<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Since IPL 2023, Virat Kohli has been in exceptional form, amassing 1,098 runs in just 25 innings with an average of 52 and a strike rate of 142.78.

Selectors are considering whether to utilize him as an opener or at the number three position, aiming to capitalize on his ability to anchor the innings. His role will be pivotal in providing stability and guiding the team through high-pressure situations, ensuring India can build substantial totals or chase down challenging targets.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Individual player stats (2)_1714294248.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Milestones Alert:-<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>49- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis<\/span> (9951) needs 49 runs to complete 10000 runs in T20s<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>3- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rashid Khan<\/span> (147) needs three wickets to complete 150 wickets in IPL<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>22- <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Rahul Tewatia<\/span> (978) needs 22 runs to complete 1000 runs in IPL.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>76- <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Virat Kohli<\/span> ( 12424) needs 76 runs to complete 12500 runs in T20s<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<ul>\n\t<li><strong>VENUE STATS:<\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>T20 AT AHMEDABAD IN IPL 2024:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>WON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/> FIRST: 1<\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>WON <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>SECOND : 3<\/strong><\/li>\n\t<li><strong>AVG 1ST INN TOTAL: 154<\/strong><\/li>\n<\/ul>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#330000\">PITCH REPORT:&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#330000\">Michael Clarke and Graeme Swann: &quot; It&#39;s a hot day, 62m and 64m are the square boundaries while down the ground is at 72m.

Yet, it requires coordination with the bowlers, especially when they&#39;re delivering full and wide deliveries. It&#39;s a strategy to keep the batters in check within their crease.Today, it worked well, particularly against a batter like David who tends to walk down the pitch. Fraser-McGurk has been outstanding since day one, displaying remarkable growth in each match. It&#39;s precisely the kind of progress you hope to see in a young player.Regarding our playoff chances, they&#39;re gradually improving, but we&#39;re adopting a game-by-game approach, focusing on the present without getting ahead of ourselves.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nJake Fraser - McGurk <\/strong><\/span><strong>is the Player of the Match&nbsp;<\/strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nJake Fraser - McGurk:&quot;<\/strong><\/span><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">It was nerve-wracking out there.

Marcus Stoinis emerged as the hero of the night, delivering a monumental innings that defied expectations. LSG won the toss and elected to field here at Chepauk considering the dew factor. CSK had a mixed start with Ajinkya Rahane falling early. Ruturaj Gaikwad, alongside Daryl Mitchell, steadied the innings. Despite Mitchell&#39;s early departure, Gaikwad&#39;s impressive knock of 108 not out and Shivam Dube&#39;s explosive 66 off 27 balls propelled CSK to 210. In the second innings, despite a shaky start with early losses, including Quinton de Kock and KL Rahul, LSG found themselves under pressure with a hefty target of 211. The game&#39;s pace changed dramatically as Stoinis, paired first with Nicholas Pooran and then Deepak Hooda, shifted gears dramatically. Stoinis not only scored a staggering 124 from 63 deliveries, but his innings also included a high-octane final over where he secured the win with three balls to spare.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image (20)_1713897445.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, CSK Captain: &quot;Tough to accept, but good game of cricket. LSG played well. We had the game in control till 14 overs, but Stoinis played a great innings. Dew played a part and it took our spinners out of the game. Otherwise, we&nbsp;could have controlled the game better and taken it deeper. But these are parts of the game. Jaddu is batting at number 4 since we lost the second wicket within the powerplay.

It was not just power hitting, it was very clever batting. You need to go harder in the powerplay and the impact player rule also gives you a bit more depth. There&rsquo;s no set plan, apart from the openers, everyone else is ready to go out whenever we feel it&#39;s right.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Marcus Stoinis is the Player of the Match<span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/crown.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Marcus Stoinis:&nbsp;&quot;There were some bowlers we wanted to target and some bowlers we wanted to be more cautious against.

Out of the four games played here, teams batting first have won twice, while teams fielding first have also emerged victorious twice. Spinners haven&#39;t dominated over seamers as expected, and the team scores have generally ranged between 180 to 190. Tonight, we find ourselves in the middle once again, with square boundaries measuring 67 meters on either side and a straight hit distance of 76 meters.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Lara: &quot;This pitch is truly a sight to behold. It&#39;s dry, hard, and impeccably even. Addressing the question of why we haven&#39;t seen scores over 200, I believe it comes down to the lack of moisture, which typically provides bounce. Without that extra bounce, players may feel cautious about playing cross-batted shots against bowlers targeting the stumps directly. While the pitch remains conducive to batting and we may still witness scores close to 200, surpassing that milestone would likely require a bit more bounce. Nonetheless, it&#39;s a beautiful pitch to bat on, and with two formidable batting teams like the Mumbai Indians and the Rajasthan Royals, we&#39;re in for an exciting contest.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (1)_1713795955.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :&nbsp; <span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO BAT FIRST&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image (23)_1713796090.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&nbsp;<strong>Hardik Pandya&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>Skipper : &quot;We are going to bat first.

A glimmer of hope emerged with a fiery 49 from Nehal Wadhera (24 balls) and a composed 65 from Tilak Varma (45 balls), but they could only manage 179.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Rajasthan&#39;s reply was nothing short of brutal. Jos Buttler (35 off 25) provided a quickfire start, but the evening belonged to the young gun, Yashasvi Jaiswal. Picking up from where he left off after a rain break, Jaiswal treated the Mumbai attack with disdain. His unbeaten 104 off a mere 60 deliveries &ndash; his second century against Mumbai and his first of the season &ndash; sealed the win in style.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mumbai&#39;s bowling attack, usually their strength, faltered under pressure. Jasprit Bumrah (0 wickets, 37 runs) and debutant Nuwan Thushara (0 wickets, 28 runs) were expensive, while dropped catches added to their misery. However, the story of the night belonged to Rajasthan&#39;s Sandeep Sharma, who ripped through the Mumbai batting order with a career-best spell of 5\/18.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image_1713811994.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Hardik Pandya <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;I think we put ourselves in trouble early on.

When the lights come on, it looks like a better wicket to bat on. It came true today.The way J. Buttler and Y. Jaiswal batted for a couple of overs after rain, we knew that we had to just reset and go back to our momentum. People are professional enough to understand what they need to do when they get a break, so I am really happy with the approach.Y. Jaiswal always gets confidence. We knew it&#39;s just a matter of one game. The way he batted in the powerplay, he was calm and composed, knowing that things are in control. We knew in the dugout that he is playing some cricketing shots and he will be fine today. I am really happy for him.We are going to Lucknow.

I got fit just two days ago, so this is my first game after recovery. Feeling really good. The pitch was on the slower and lower side, so my plan was to keep bowling those variations, including cutters. It worked out really nicely tonight.If you&#39;re bowling in the end, you have to have a big heart. As we&#39;ve seen in this IPL, bowlers are under pressure and batsmen are going big. So it&#39;s important to keep believing in yourself, and execute your variations and plans. That&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to do, and I&#39;m enjoying myself. As you know, two years ago, I went unsold and came in as a replacement. So, any game I get to play, I consider it a bonus and just enjoy myself.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","MatchRow":38,"ProjectedScore":"196","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Sandeep Sharma","MOM_TYPE":"Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"220","MOMRuns":"-","MOMBalls":"-","MOMWicket":"5","MOMRC":"18","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/2mFGpi3WOl1712560966220.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1419,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-04-21","MatchDateNew":"21 Apr 2024","MatchName":"Punjab Kings vs Gujarat Titans","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"13:45 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-04-21","FirstBattingTeamID":15,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Punjab Kings","SecondBattingTeamID":35,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","FirstBattingTeamCode":"PBKS","SecondBattingTeamCode":"GT","GroundID":131,"GroundName":"PCA New Stadium","Commentss":"Gujarat Titans Won by 3  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Punjab Kings","TossDetails":"Punjab Kings Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Bat","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"142\/10 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"146\/7 (19.1 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-04-21 19:30:00","city":"Mullanpur","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/insider.in\/tata-ipl-2024-match-37-punjab-kings-vs-gujarat-titans-april21\/event?utm_source=IPL&utm_medium=website","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":77,"GroundUmpire2ID":191,"GroundUmpire3ID":525,"RefereeID":86,"HomeTeamID":"15","HomeTeamName":"Punjab Kings","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"35","AwayTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"21 Apr 2024","MatchEndTime":"23:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":37,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Vineet Kulkarni","GroundUmpire2":"Nanda Kishore","ThirdUmpire":"Khalid Saiyed","Comments":"Gujarat Titans Won By 3  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000120-7489ddcc449711","CurrentStrikerName":"Rahul Tewatia","StrikerRuns":36,"StrikerBalls":18,"StrikerFours":7,"StrikerSixes":0,"StrikerSR":200,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/UJBfjMpLzp1711262739120.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2020-100mb00000000544-980117aa639c11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Sai Kishore","NonStrikerRuns":0,"NonStrikerBalls":0,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":0,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/6UOmJx4wQI1711263099544.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2019-100mb00000000125-2485f88b449911","CurrentBowlerName":"Arshdeep Singh","BowlerOvers":"2.1","BowlerRuns":17,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":1,"BowlerEconomy":7.85,"BowlerSR":13,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/A3OtoulUW21711170102125.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"142\/10 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"142","1FallWickets":"10","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"7.1","2Summary":"146\/7 (19.1 Overs)","2FallScore":"146","2FallWickets":"7","2FallOvers":"19.1","2RunRate":"7.62","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"35","MatchOrder":"Match 37","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>The stage is set for a riveting IPL clash in Mullanpur, where Punjab Kings&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/> face off against Gujarat Titans <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/>.

Chasing a below-par total of 143 runs, GT emerged triumphant by 3 wickets with 5 balls to spare, thanks to a late onslaught by the swashbuckling Rahul Tewatia. Opting to bat first, Punjab Kings got off to a promising start with openers Prabhsimran Singh and Sam Curran stitching together a 52-run partnership. However, their batting woes resurfaced as wickets fell in quick succession. The middle order failed to capitalize, leaving the team reeling at 99\/7 after 16 overs. A late cameo from Harpreet Brar (29 runs off 12 balls) provided a much-needed boost, taking Punjab past the 140-run mark. The innings eventually folded for a meager 142 runs, with Sai Kishore wreaking havoc for Gujarat Titans, claiming a four-wicket haul. Mohit Sharma and Noor Ahmad chipped in with two wickets each, while Rashid Khan picked up one. Gujarat&#39;s chase began on a shaky note as they lost their prolific wicket-keeper batsman Wriddhiman Saha early on. However, the young guns Shubman Gill and Sai Sudharsan displayed maturity, consolidating the innings with a 40-run partnership. Just as GT seemed to be in control, Liam Livingstone rattled their batting order, dismissing the dangerous David Miller and the in-form Gill. With the score reading 89\/4 and victory slipping away, Rahul Tewatia rose to the occasion. He played a blistering knock of 36 runs off just 18 balls, peppering the boundaries with his trademark sixes. His aggressive batting reignited Gujarat&#39;s hopes and put the pressure back on Punjab. Despite losing a couple of late wickets, GT secured a thrilling victory with 5 balls remaining, thanks to Tewatia&#39;s heroics.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image_1713723554.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Sam Curran&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;I believe we fell short by about 10-15 runs.

Let&#39;s delve into recent history. Last time at Eden Gardens, Kolkata Knight Riders amassed 223, with Sunil Narine even reaching a century. Despite that, Rajasthan Royals successfully chased down the target. So, you&#39;d expect a plethora of runs on this pitch. However, being an afternoon game alters the dynamics entirely. Let me quickly remind you of the boundaries: one short boundary to my right, roughly 61 meters, and to the left, 66 meters.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Swann: &quot;Oh, it&#39;s incredibly hot out here today, a scorching <span style=\"color:#d35400\">43 degrees<\/span> in the middle. This pitch is going to feel the brunt of it. It&#39;s parched, very dry indeed. This strip has been used before, and there&#39;s one fascinating aspect I&#39;d like to point out. Most of the pitch is fairly even, but there&#39;s this distinct band here in the good length area. It&#39;s a big circle of dryness, forming a slight arc across the wicket. The grass has been trimmed more in this section, making it a tad plainer than the rest. Whether this translates to drier conditions or more sun exposure remains to be seen. Spinners might find this intriguing as it&#39;s about a spinner&#39;s length. Bowling from that end could yield some movement, but overall, this pitch looks fantastic, and I anticipate a run-fest.&quot;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Manjrekar: &quot;The burning question for an afternoon clash: win the toss, what&#39;s your call?&quot;<\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Swann: &quot;I&#39;d opt to bat first. It might not be the popular choice as many prefer to chase, but considering the intense heat, it could prove to be a significant advantage. So, my vote goes to batting first.&quot;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1713692630.gif\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS UPDATE :&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#27ae60\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD FIRST&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image (2)_1713694551.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Faf du Plessis <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to chase. Eden Gardens has a history of favoring the chasing side, and we&#39;ll stick to that strategy today. We observed the conditions yesterday, and it did get cooler after a while, so we&#39;ll look to adapt accordingly. T20 cricket has evolved, and even conceding runs in the powerplay doesn&#39;t necessarily mean poor bowling. The key is to take wickets consistently, even if the opposition is scoring, and capitalize on the latter part of their innings.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Last time around, we played an afternoon game here, so we&#39;ve got a good sense of how the pitch behaves.

It&#39;s crucial to adapt quickly to the conditions, execute our plans, and play each ball on its merit.

Kolkata Knight Riders (KKR) and Royal Challengers Bangalore (RCB) engaged in a high-octane battle, culminating in a heart-stopping finish that saw KKR edge out by the slimmest of margins, a solitary run. The day commenced with KKR taking the crease first after RCB opted to field. The innings started on a shaky note with Sunil Narine returning to the pavilion early, managing only 10 runs off 15 balls. Despite Sunil Narine&#39;s early dismissal, Phil Salt set the stage ablaze.&nbsp;Displaying a masterclass in aggressive batting, Salt blazed through RCB&#39;s bowling lineup, hammering 48 runs from just 14 balls, electrifying the crowd with his audacious strokes. Though Angkrish Raghuvanshi and Venkatesh Iyer couldn&rsquo;t make significant contributions, scoring 3 and 16 runs respectively, it was Shreyas Iyer who anchored the innings. Displaying maturity and finesse, Shreyas crafted a well-composed 50 off 36 balls. The innings was further bolstered by cameos from Rinku Singh, who added a quickfire 24, and the duo of Andre Russell and Ramandeep Singh, who remained not out, contributing 27 and 24 runs respectively to set a formidable target of 222\/6 for RCB. As RCB began their chase, Virat Kohli launched an onslaught, albeit briefly, smashing 18 runs off just 7 balls before his dismissal. Faf du Plessis, usually reliable, faltered and was dismissed for 7, leaving RCB in a precarious position. However, the tide turned with Will Jacks and Rajat Patidar at the crease. The pair orchestrated a stunning display of batting, both reaching their fifties and adding over 100 runs together, momentarily putting RCB in a dominant position. But the game was far from over. Andre Russell, known for his knack for crucial breakthroughs, was introduced into the attack and delivered spectacularly by removing both set batters in a single over. This pivotal moment swung the momentum back in favour of KKR as RCB began losing wickets at regular intervals. Despite a valiant 25 from Dinesh Karthik, RCB found themselves needing 21 runs from the final over with Karn Sharma on strike. In an over that defined the term &#39;cliffhanger,&#39; Sharma hammered Mitchell Starc for three sixes in four balls, dramatically reducing the equation to 3 runs needed from the final two deliveries. The penultimate ball saw Starc taking a stunning low catch off his own bowling to dismiss Sharma. With one ball left and the scores almost level, Lockie Ferguson came to the crease, managed to score only one run, and was run out while attempting the second run that would have tied the game. This last-ball thriller, where the match hung in balance till the final moment, was a showcase of cricket at its most exhilarating. The pendulum of fortune swung wildly before resting in KKR&#39;s favour, concluding a match that was nothing less than a saga of dramatic twists, individual brilliance, and nerve-wracking excitement.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image_1713712504.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>Faf du Plessis <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#27ae60\"><strong>It was crazy, rules are rules. Virat and I thought that the ball was higher than the waist (on Kohli&#39;s dismissal). I guess they measured from the popping crease. One team thinks it&#39;s high, the other doesn&#39;t. That&#39;s how the game goes at times. Then the partnership, it was magnificent (on the Jacks-Patidar partnership), but when you don&#39;t win too many games, some sort of panic sets in and the Narine over was game-changing. You don&#39;t feel that you have time to settle down and bat (on the evolution of the IPL this season). The game doesn&#39;t allow it to do that; obviously, you have an extra batter, but in chases like these, you have to keep going. The match-up against Narine, I thought that was the game-changing over. The small things, I am actually proud of the boys tonight, the way we bowled and fielded. We did give away a couple of big overs towards the end, but I thought we kept them down to a par score. We thought we&#39;ll go hard in the batting powerplay, find those boundaries at the start of the innings. We were desperate, 10\/10 from an effort perspective, the way we put up the effort on the ground, the faces told the story. We&#39;ve got an unbelievable fanbase, we want to make them happy, we want them to have a smile on their face. We&#39;ll have to continue putting in our efforts and try to change things around.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;It takes a lot off your body and drains you out completely because you go through so many emotions. It&rsquo;s tough to stay calm but I&rsquo;m elated. We got two points on the board and that&rsquo;s all that matters. It&rsquo;s extremely tough when the pressure is on; I feel that every individual should put their hands up and take the responsibility. Russell did that by picking up two wickets and completely changed the game in our favor; that kind of attitude is needed in the team. It&rsquo;s a funny game, when you need 18 runs off 6 balls, the pressure is on the bowler. One six here and there, it completely changes the momentum. It is important that we maintain our calmness and stay in the present and make the batter hit where you want them to hit. We need to stick to our routines and processes and see to it that we execute the things we want. It was a pivotal knock; I wanted to stay till the end and steady the ship. We were losing wickets and I wanted to stay till the end and see it off. We got some important boundaries towards the end and I was very happy about that.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nAndre Russell, Player of the match&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>:<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>&quot;Thanks to the almighty. I always back my bowling as I said earlier. Getting the ball at a crucial time, I knew that I had to come good and thankfully it happened today. Happy for the two points. When I was batting earlier, change of pace was difficult to hit. As a bowler that&rsquo;s what I wanted to do. The slower balls were gripping and holding. Was happy to get the two set batters out and I think that&rsquo;s what changed the game. Those two wickets from Narine were also very important and that&rsquo;s what started the slide for RCB. When I look at the bowling equation, I had two left and I conditioned myself to bowl that (19th) over. Tried to give Starc as many runs as I could. DK wasn&rsquo;t getting off strike so I looked at bowling 6 deliveries to him and mix it up, thankfully it worked.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":36,"ProjectedScore":"221","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Andre Russell","MOM_TYPE":"Batting\/Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"141","MOMRuns":"27","MOMBalls":"20","MOMWicket":"3","MOMRC":"25","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/k9HNNNr5UH1711106337141.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1417,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-04-20","MatchDateNew":"20 Apr 2024","MatchName":"Delhi Capitals vs Sunrisers Hyderabad","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-04-20","FirstBattingTeamID":20,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Sunrisers Hyderabad","SecondBattingTeamID":14,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","FirstBattingTeamCode":"SRH","SecondBattingTeamCode":"DC","GroundID":17,"GroundName":"Arun Jaitley Stadium","Commentss":"Sunrisers Hyderabad Won by 67  Runs ","TossTeam":"Delhi Capitals","TossDetails":"Delhi Capitals Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":0,"FirstBattingSummary":"266\/7 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"199\/10 (19.1 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-04-20 19:30:00","city":"Delhi","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/insider.in\/tata-ipl-2024-match35-delhi-capitals-vs-sunrisers-hyderabad-april20\/event?utm_source=IPL&utm_medium=website","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":129,"GroundUmpire2ID":221,"GroundUmpire3ID":363,"RefereeID":220,"HomeTeamID":"14","HomeTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"20","AwayTeamName":"Sunrisers Hyderabad","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"20 Apr 2024","MatchEndTime":"23:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":35,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Navdeep Singh","GroundUmpire2":"Madanagopal Jayaraman","ThirdUmpire":"Tapan Balwant Sharma","Comments":"Sunrisers Hyderabad Won By 67  Runs ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/SRH.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/SRH.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2018-100mb00000000018-6e65e6f7e99c11","CurrentStrikerName":"Rishabh Pant","StrikerRuns":44,"StrikerBalls":35,"StrikerFours":5,"StrikerSixes":1,"StrikerSR":125.71,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/CBJeO6dA8l171117091218.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2022-100mb00000001462-cbc59298427c11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Mukesh Kumar","NonStrikerRuns":0,"NonStrikerBalls":2,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":0,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/mtYoBn1aVp17111708761462.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2023-100mb00000001944-c9a4b0e8c40511","CurrentBowlerName":"Nitish Kumar Reddy","BowlerOvers":"2.1","BowlerRuns":17,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":2,"BowlerEconomy":7.85,"BowlerSR":6.5,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/IozBAaYkzy17111722041944.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"266\/7 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"266","1FallWickets":"7","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"13.3","2Summary":"199\/10 (19.1 Overs)","2FallScore":"199","2FallWickets":"10","2FallOvers":"19.1","2RunRate":"10.38","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"20","MatchOrder":"Match 35","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Hello and welcome to the live coverage of TATA IPL 2024 match 35, which marks the end of the first half of the group stage.

Their bowling, however, has been a cause for concern. While Pat Cummins and T Natarajan have impressed so far, the rest of the attack has leaked runs. SRH will need to tighten things up if they want to continue their winning ways.&nbsp;For DC, bowling has been their trump card in recent wins. The Indian pace trio of Ishant Sharma, Khaleel Ahmed, and Mukesh Kumar have been firing on all cylinders. Spinners Kuldeep Yadav and Axar Patel add further depth to a well-balanced attack.&nbsp;The arrival of Jake Fraser-McGurk has bolstered the DC batting line-up. He and the experienced duo of Rishabh Pant and Prithvi Shaw provide a solid foundation. However, a question mark hangs over David Warner&#39;s availability, which could be a concern for the Capitals.&nbsp;This match promises to be a thrilling battle between a resurgent DC bowling attack and a free-scoring SRH batting line-up. Can the Capitals contain the orange brigade&#39;s batting blitz? Or will SRH continue their record-breaking run?

SRH, after being put to bat first, unleashed carnage from the get-go. The opening duo of Travis Head (89 off 32 balls) and Abhishek Sharma (46 off 12 balls) tore into the DC bowling, putting on a record-breaking 131-run partnership in just 38 balls! The powerplay was a nightmare for the Capitals as SRH amassed a staggering 125 runs. The onslaught continued with valuable contributions from Nitish Kumar Reddy (37 off 27 balls), Shahbaz Ahmed (59 off 29 balls), and Abdul Samad (13 off 8 balls). SRH finished their innings at a mammoth 266\/7, the highest total in IPL history for the third time this season!&nbsp;Only the spin duo of Kuldeep Yadav (4-55) and Axar Patel (1-29) offered some resistance for DC. The pacers were taken to the cleaners, with Mukesh Kumar picking up a solitary wicket but conceding a lot of runs.&nbsp;Chasing a near-impossible target of 267, DC started brightly. Impact player Prithvi Shaw smashed four boundaries in the opening over but was dismissed cheaply by Washington Sundar. David Warner also departed early. However, Jake Fraser-McGurk (65 off 18 balls) and Abhishek Porel (42 off 22 balls) provided a glimmer of hope with their aggressive knocks. But the dismissal of Porel triggered a collapse, and DC were eventually bowled out for 199 in 19.1 overs.T Natarajan (4-19) was the wrecker-in-chief for SRH, picking up four crucial wickets. Nitish Kumar Reddy, Mayank Markande, Washington Sundar, and Bhuvneshwar Kumar chipped in with wickets as well.&nbsp;This comprehensive 67-run victory propels SRH to the second position in the points table. For DC, it&#39;s a bitter pill to swallow as they lose their first game at home. The match highlighted the destructive power of the SRH batting line-up and the need for DC to strengthen their bowling attack, especially their pace department.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (1)_1713637970.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Rishabh Pant&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;<\/strong><\/span><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>The decision to bowl first was mainly based on the expectation of dew, which didn&#39;t materialize.

I expect the pitch to hold a bit more due to its Wankhede-like appearance. Being inland, there may not be as much spin since the soil doesn&#39;t compact tightly. However, I anticipate it to play well overall. The new ball will be crucial, and finding wickets in the powerplay will be key on this surface.

KL Rahul&#39;s astute decision to bowl first proved to be advantageous. CSK, with the help of a valiant 57* from Ravindra Jadeja and contributions from Ajinkya Rahane (36) and MS Dhoni (28* off 9), could manage a fighting total of 176\/6. Krunal Pandya and Marcus Stoinis were the bowling stars for LSG, keeping the CSK batsmen in check.&nbsp;In response,&nbsp;Openers KL Rahul (82 off 53) and Quinton de Kock (54 off 43) stitched together a magnificent 134-run partnership to lay the foundation for victory. Even after de Kock&#39;s dismissal, Rahul continued his aggressive knock, but a sensational one-handed catch by Jadeja brought his innings to an end. Nicholas Pooran and Marcus Stoinis ensured a comfortable finish, securing the win for LSG with 1 over to spare.&nbsp;CSK&#39;s bowlers struggled to contain the LSG batsmen. Matheesha Pathirana (1\/29 in 4 overs) offered some resistance.&nbsp;This win propels LSG to 8 points on the table, joining the likes of KKR, CSK, and SRH. Both CSK and LSG find themselves in the top five, with the reverse fixture scheduled for Tuesday in Chennai.

With the impact sub rule, you need extra runs. Pitches like these start off sluggish but improve with dew. 190 would have been a good score. One area we need to improve is taking wickets in the power play to put pressure on the opposition. It&#39;s good to play them again in the next game at Chepauk.

The bowlers executed really well, and the team is sticking to the plans. At the halfway stage, I would have been happy with 160, considering the slow wicket and grip. MSD walking in put pressure on the bowlers, as he has had that intimidation factor on opposition bowlers. Our young bowlers were under pressure with the crowd going berserk as well, giving the opposition 15-20 extra runs. I&#39;ve been trying to assess the situation, and it came off today. I knew the CSK spinners would put pressure on, so I picked my bowlers accordingly. Quinton batted well too, making life easy for both of us. Playing in Chennai is a different ball game, especially in front of a mini Chennai crowd.

Another tricky aspect is the shorter boundaries behind the wicket, just 58 and 56 meters, which will have players strategizing. The pitch also has a bit of green, which I like.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Anjum Chopra added her perspective on the implications for the bowlers, &quot;Given the pocket-sized boundaries, it&#39;s seemingly tough for the bowlers. However, this ground has been quite favourable for them. Yes, spinners have performed well, but it&rsquo;s the seamers who really made a mark in the last game by hitting hard lengths and troubling the batters. The seamers have excelled, which isn&#39;t great news for the batters.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Danny also noted, &quot;The average first innings score here is 168.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Anjum concluded, &quot;While that&#39;s a decent score, teams might want a bit more on the board given the conditions.

However, a solid partnership between Rohit and SKY steadied the ship. SKY then continued the momentum alongside Tilak Varma, adding another 49 runs. Late cameos from David and Pandya pushed the total to a respectable 193. Harshal Patel and Sam Curran kept things tight for Punjab with three and two wickets respectively, but the score proved challenging nonetheless.&nbsp;Punjab&#39;s chase began disastrously. They were in tatters at 14-4 after just 2.1 overs. Hope seemed lost as wickets continued to tumble, leaving them at a precarious 77-6 by the 10th over.&nbsp;Enter Ashutosh, the unlikely hero! In a stunning display of power hitting, he blazed a trail of destruction with a blistering 28-ball 61. Helicopter pulls, audacious sixes off Bumrah and Madhwal - Ashutosh, alongside Shashank, brought Punjab back into the contest. With MI gasping for air, victory seemed within reach for the Kings.&nbsp;But alas, it wasn&#39;t meant to be. Just when Punjab sniffed victory, Ashutosh holed out in the deep, leaving them 25 runs short of the target. The lower order couldn&#39;t manage the chase, and Mumbai&#39;s bowlers, led by the ever-reliable Bumrah, ensured their side crossed the finish line. Bumrah, with his miserly spells and crucial wickets, once again proved his worth as Mumbai&#39;s death-overs ace.&nbsp;Ashutosh&#39;s heroics and Shashank&#39;s gritty knock threatened to rewrite the script, but Bumrah remained unfazed. He also topped the purple cap list again&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/purple-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" \/>. However, it was a fiery spell from the young Coetzee that ultimately swung the momentum back in Mumbai&#39;s favour. This match will be remembered for Ashutosh&#39;s valiant knock and another heart-breaking last-over defeat for Punjab Kings, their fourth in IPL 2024.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/Untitled_1713468344.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Sam Curran,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;captain: &quot;It was a close one indeed. This team seems to thrive on close matches. Credit to Ashutosh for getting us so close; his effort was exceptional. Losing close games is always tough, especially when you&#39;ve been losing early wickets consistently throughout the tournament. It&#39;s heartbreaking for the guys to come so close and still end up on the losing side. Ashutosh and Shashank showed incredible confidence in their game; Ashutosh&#39;s ability to sweep fast bowlers is impressive. Hopefully, we can turn these close encounters into wins and build some momentum. It&#39;s been a roller-coaster ride, winning one game and then losing the next. I&#39;d rather lose close matches than get completely outplayed.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Hardik Pandya,&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;captain: &quot;It was indeed a very good game of cricket. Everyone&#39;s nerves were put to the test. We discussed before the game that our character would be tested, and that&#39;s exactly what happened. Even though you feel you&#39;re ahead in the game, the IPL has a way of producing these close encounters. Ashutosh&#39;s knock was unbelievable - he was hitting almost every ball in the middle. I&#39;m happy for him and excited for his future. During the timeout, we emphasized that it doesn&#39;t matter how good we look; we need to keep scrapping in this game. There were moments where we were a bit soft, but in the end, a win is a win.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Jasprit Bumrah <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/purple-cap.png\" style=\"height:24px; width:24px\" title=\"\" \/>, Player of the Match: &quot;It was a closer game than we anticipated. Naturally, as a bowler, you want to make an impact when conditions favour the ball. In this format, the ball swings for only a couple of overs, unlike Test cricket where I can bowl more and have a greater influence. T20 cricket presents challenges for bowlers due to time constraints and rules favouring impact players. The batting lineups also tend to become deeper, which is beyond our control. I try to relay messages to the bowlers when possible, but I also avoid overloading them with information during the heat of the moment.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":33,"ProjectedScore":"191","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Jasprit Bumrah","MOM_TYPE":"Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"9","MOMRuns":"-","MOMBalls":"-","MOMWicket":"3","MOMRC":"21","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/7ID0MgCukM17112091009.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1413,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-04-17","MatchDateNew":"17 Apr 2024","MatchName":"Gujarat Titans vs Delhi Capitals","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-04-17","FirstBattingTeamID":35,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","SecondBattingTeamID":14,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","FirstBattingTeamCode":"GT","SecondBattingTeamCode":"DC","GroundID":55,"GroundName":"Narendra Modi Stadium","Commentss":"Delhi Capitals Won by 6   Wickets ","TossTeam":"Delhi Capitals","TossDetails":"Delhi Capitals Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":0,"FirstBattingSummary":"89\/10 (17.3 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"92\/4 (8.5 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-04-17 19:30:00","city":"Ahmedabad","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/insider.in\/tata-ipl-2024-match-32-gujarat-titans-vs-delhi-capitals-apr-17\/event?utm_source=IPL&utm_medium=website","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":87,"GroundUmpire2ID":95,"GroundUmpire3ID":221,"RefereeID":87,"HomeTeamID":"35","HomeTeamName":"Gujarat Titans","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"14","AwayTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"17 Apr 2024","MatchEndTime":"23:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":32,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Virender Kumar Sharma","GroundUmpire2":"Nikhil Patwardhan","ThirdUmpire":"Madanagopal Jayaraman","Comments":"Delhi Capitals Won By 6   Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/GT.png?v=1","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2022-100mb00000000975-56f6385ba44611","CurrentStrikerName":"Noor Ahmad","StrikerRuns":1,"StrikerBalls":7,"StrikerFours":0,"StrikerSixes":0,"StrikerSR":14.28,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/LG0Noz0HPU1711263543975.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2023-100mb00000002518-9a5f0c5357b311","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Spencer Johnson","NonStrikerRuns":1,"NonStrikerBalls":1,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":100,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/81YMDUAVI517112629762518.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2022-100mb00000001462-cbc59298427c11","CurrentBowlerName":"Mukesh Kumar","BowlerOvers":"2.3","BowlerRuns":14,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":3,"BowlerEconomy":5.6,"BowlerSR":5,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/mtYoBn1aVp17111708761462.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"89\/10 (17.3 Overs)","1FallScore":"89","1FallWickets":"10","1FallOvers":"17.3","1RunRate":"5.09","2Summary":"92\/4 (8.5 Overs)","2FallScore":"92","2FallWickets":"4","2FallOvers":"8.5","2RunRate":"10.42","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"14","MatchOrder":"Match 32","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Gujarat Titans are set to host Delhi Capitals in match number 32 of the TATA IPL 2024 at the iconic Narendra Modi Stadium in Ahmedabad on April 17th.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Gujarat Titans enter the contest buoyed by a historic chase in their previous game, propelled by Shubman Gill&#39;s robust batting and a thrilling finish by Rashid Khan and Rahul Tewatia.

The square boundaries measure 61m and 72m, while the straight hit extends to 75m. It&#39;s a scorching 41 degrees today, and with such high temperatures, dew might become a significant factor as the game progresses.

Bowling, fielding, and captaincy - everything clicked for Delhi today. Rishabh Pant&#39;s decision to bowl first, though initially hesitant, proved to be a stroke of genius. The Delhi bowlers, led by the experienced Ishant Sharma, exploited the slow pitch conditions perfectly. Some deliveries kept low, creating problems for the GT batsmen. While the spinners found some grip, the majority of the GT dismissals were self-inflicted due to poor shot selection.&nbsp;This is Gujarat Titans&#39; lowest total in IPL history! Their previous lowest score of 125, coincidentally, also came against Delhi Capitals in Ahmedabad last year. Rashid Khan&#39;s valiant 31 was a lone bright spot in an otherwise disastrous batting display for GT.&nbsp;Mukesh Kumar emerged as the star bowler for Delhi, grabbing a well-deserved three wickets for a mere 14 runs. Fraser-McGurk, the young opener, threatened a quick chase but was dismissed by Spencer Johnson. Sandeep Warrier chipped in with a couple of wickets as well.&nbsp;Delhi, always keeping an eye on the Net Run Rate, ensured they wrapped up the innings quickly. They finished the chase in just 8.5 overs, giving their NRR a significant boost while simultaneously depleting Gujarat&#39;s.&nbsp;This comprehensive victory sees a massive shakeup in the points table! The Capitals climb from ninth to a much more comfortable sixth position, while the Titans slide down from sixth to seventh.

The pitch itself was alright; the dismissals were more about poor shot selection than anything else.

It&#39;s a clash of the table-toppers, promising a high-octane match. The field dimensions here vary significantly, with a 12-meter difference square of the wicket&mdash;59 meters to the right and 71 meters to the left, with the straight boundary at 75 meters. Bowlers will likely focus on defending the bigger side. Michael, we&#39;ve seen diverse outcomes here; what&#39;s your take on today&#39;s pitch?&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarke: &quot;The conditions are similar to the previous game. We thought 190 was a standard score during the day. Tonight, dew will likely play a role, making teams prefer chasing. It&rsquo;s a fantastic surface, complemented by a very quick outfield and fairly even boundaries. It&rsquo;s an excellent pitch that favors batting at any point, especially with the new ball when the pitch is hardest.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Badree: &quot;Considering the impact of bowlers like Sunil Narine, who has been economical here, how should teams approach facing him?&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Clarke: &quot;Narine stands out as a key bowler for KKR, challenging batters who struggle to read him. The key against him is to watch his hand closely. Batters must pick the ball from his hand, which is easier said than done but essential for success against his spin.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-16T185433_1713274115.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\nTOSS:&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/span><span style=\"color:#ff0099\"> WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2024-04-16T193455_1713276350.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#ff0099\"><strong>Sanju Samson <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper :&nbsp; &nbsp;&quot;We&#39;ve chosen to bowl first.

It was a night of spectacular performances and heart-stopping moments culminating in a last-ball thriller. The game kicked off with KKR&#39;s decision to bat first, a move that saw Sunil Narine stepping up in a big way. The Trinidadian exploded with a fiery century, scoring 109 runs that included a barrage of boundaries. His maiden IPL century left the Royals&#39; spinners, including veterans like Ashwin and Chahal, scrambling for answers.&nbsp;Rajasthan&#39;s chase began promisingly with Yashasvi Jaiswal giving the team a brisk start. However, the innings soon encountered turbulence as wickets fell at regular intervals. Sanju Samson and Riyan Parag tried to stabilize the inning with Buttler on one end, but their efforts were insufficient to keep the required rate in check. Just when all seemed lost, Jos Buttler took charge in a display of sheer determination and skill. Alongside Rovman Powell, who contributed with a quickfire cameo, Buttler steered the chase back on track. The duo&#39;s vital partnership breathed new life into RR&#39;s innings, setting the stage for a dramatic finale. The match reached its climax in the final over. Buttler, standing firm and undeterred, struck a crucial six early in the over before playing it smart with a calculated single in the last ball.&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2024-04-17T000928_1713293437.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; Skipper: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s a tough pill to swallow.

With Buttler striking cleanly, we tried slowing it down by giving Varun the last over, hoping the lack of pace would help, but it&rsquo;s challenging with five inside the circle.

If they lose, expect drama. It&#39;s interesting, the boundary dimensions here&mdash;57 meters off-side, 64 meters leg side, and 69 meters straight&mdash;are so compact they hardly impact the game.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Aaron Finch: &quot;Looking at the pitch, there&rsquo;s a lot of green grass, albeit patchy. This means for fast bowlers, some balls will zip and others will skid with the new ball. More intriguing is the amount of spin we&#39;ve seen here this season, more than any other venue. The pitch, with its dry spin and cracking surface, will likely favor the spinners as the game progresses. While there&#39;s some dew, it&rsquo;s not as significant as Wankhede, favoring the team batting second.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 - 2024-04-15T192515_1713189375.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS: <span style=\"color:#000066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2024-04-15T193521_1713189977.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Faf du Plessis| <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;We&#39;re set for a chase tonight, which has been typical this season.

Despite their valiant effort, RCB fell short by 25 runs while chasing down a mammoth 288 set by SRH.A brutal opening assault laid the foundation for Hyderabad&#39;s victory. Travis Head, in particular, was unstoppable, reaching his century in a mere 39 balls - the fourth-fastest in IPL history. The carnage continued as Heinrich Klaasen blitzed his way to a 23-ball fifty. Later cameos from Aiden Markram and the big-hitting Abdul Samad ensured SRH crossed the 280-run mark with ease, posting a record-breaking total of 287.RCB&#39;s chase started brightly with Faf du Plessis and Virat Kohli taking the attack to the bowlers. However, Kohli&#39;s dismissal triggered a collapse, and wickets quickly fell. Mayank Markande, the impactful substitute, and Pat Cummins stifled the chase with crucial wickets despite the pitch offering minimal assistance. Dinesh Karthik, though, provided a lone fightback with a scintillating 83 off just 35 balls, but his knock lacked support from the other end.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>This match will be forever remembered for the sheer volume of runs scored. With a staggering 549 runs amassed, it rewrote the record books for the highest-scoring T20 match ever witnessed.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image - 2024-04-15T234117_1713204701.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Travis Head (Man of the Match): &quot;After my innings, I took a shower and enjoyed some good food. The pitch played beautifully today. We received some insights from the groundsmen and knew we needed to adapt during the initial six overs. Our batting order was set up nicely, giving everyone the freedom to aggressively target the bowlers. Abhishek Sharma and I have a great partnership; we really complement each other and boost each other&rsquo;s confidence. I&rsquo;m really enjoying batting alongside him. As for how to bowl to me, I&#39;m not sure there&rsquo;s a straightforward strategy. Bowlers have tried various approaches, but nothing specific has stood out. While my technique might not be the prettiest, I&rsquo;m really pleased with how I struck the ball today.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins(SRH Skipper):&quot;I sometimes wish I was a batter, especially after a game like today. We had a similar experience against Mumbai, and I thought it wouldn&#39;t happen again, but here we are. You do your best as a bowler. Even an over where you concede just seven or eight runs can really impact the match significantly. Honestly, I&#39;ve stopped trying to predict how pitches will play here at Chinnaswamy. Despite appearances, they often turn out to be fantastic for batting. We&#39;ve secured four wins so far. It&#39;s really the freedom with which our players are performing that&#39;s been the highlight. It&rsquo;s great to see them continue to play with such liberty, and I&rsquo;m really pleased with how everyone is performing.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Faf du Plessis(RCB Skipper): &quot;Yeah, it was definitely a quintessential T20 pitch. The amount of runs scored today was extraordinary, possibly a world record. So credit to us for staying in the fight and trying to keep up, although 270 isn&#39;t too far off. Behind the scenes, we&#39;ve been experimenting with different strategies to find what works best, but it&#39;s been tough. Cricket can be a merciless game. When you&#39;re struggling with confidence, there&#39;s really nowhere to hide on the field. We&#39;ve been tweaking our approach, like incorporating leg spin in the middle overs. In terms of batting, we&#39;ve pinpointed areas where we need to push harder, especially after the powerplay considering the high scores. Despite the resilience the team has shown, giving up 30-40 extra runs in our bowling was pivotal. After a game like this, it&#39;s crucial to take a break and clear our heads. The mental strain of such defeats is significant, and right now, it feels like we&#39;re facing an uphill battle.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":30,"ProjectedScore":"262","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Travis Head","MOM_TYPE":"Batting","MOMPlayerId":"37","MOMRuns":"102","MOMBalls":"41","MOMWicket":"-","MOMRC":"-","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/UcE1cNJKGb171117273637.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1411,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-04-14","MatchDateNew":"14 Apr 2024","MatchName":"Mumbai Indians vs Chennai Super Kings","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-04-14","FirstBattingTeamID":13,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","SecondBattingTeamID":17,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Mumbai Indians","FirstBattingTeamCode":"CSK","SecondBattingTeamCode":"MI","GroundID":21,"GroundName":"Wankhede Stadium","Commentss":"Chennai Super Kings Won by 20  Runs ","TossTeam":"Mumbai Indians","TossDetails":"Mumbai Indians Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"206\/4 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"186\/6 (20.0 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-04-14 19:30:00","city":"Mumbai","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/in.bookmyshow.com\/sports\/mumbai-indians-vs-chennai-super-kings\/ET00392852","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":42,"GroundUmpire2ID":525,"GroundUmpire3ID":87,"RefereeID":86,"HomeTeamID":"17","HomeTeamName":"Mumbai Indians","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"13","AwayTeamName":"Chennai Super Kings","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"14 Apr 2024","MatchEndTime":"23:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":29,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Nitin Menon","GroundUmpire2":"Khalid Saiyed","ThirdUmpire":"Virender Kumar Sharma","Comments":"Chennai Super Kings Won By 20  Runs ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/MI.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/MI.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/CSK.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2018-100mb00000000006-2cf4bba8e99b11","CurrentStrikerName":"Rohit Sharma","StrikerRuns":105,"StrikerBalls":63,"StrikerFours":11,"StrikerSixes":5,"StrikerSR":166.66,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/PkGocfnXm717112088856.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000217-29d6c58644bf11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Mohammad Nabi","NonStrikerRuns":4,"NonStrikerBalls":7,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":57.14,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/UfEtDAomXm1711208571217.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2022-100mb00000001014-1f0cfb3dc17911","CurrentBowlerName":"Matheesha Pathirana","BowlerOvers":"4.0","BowlerRuns":28,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":4,"BowlerEconomy":7,"BowlerSR":6,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/KJCZZ2GM6p17114657091014.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"206\/4 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"206","1FallWickets":"4","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"10.3","2Summary":"186\/6 (20.0 Overs)","2FallScore":"186","2FallWickets":"6","2FallOvers":"20.0","2RunRate":"9.3","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"13","MatchOrder":"Match 29","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p>The upcoming clash between <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/MI-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:29px\" title=\"\" \/> and <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" \/> at the Wankhede Stadium in the 2024 IPL is set to be a thrilling encounter.

The team has showcased potential in flashes but has struggled to maintain consistency, especially in crunch situations.

With the likes of Andre Russell and Venkatesh Iyer adding firepower to their lineup, KKR looks well-equipped to extend their winning momentum.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Key Battles to Watch out :&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The clash between CSK&#39;s batting prowess and KKR&#39;s spin wizards will be a spectacle, with both teams looking to leverage Chennai&#39;s pitch conditions. <span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Shivam Dube&#39;<\/strong><\/span>s aggressive batting will be crucial for CSK to counter the spin threat posed by <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Narine and Chakravarthy<\/strong><\/span>.

Their victory over <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; wasn&#39;t just about superior skills but a demonstration of acute tactical awareness and execution that outclassed their opponents in every department. The turning point of the match undoubtedly came in the 7th over when Ravindra Jadeja, CSK&#39;s spin wizard, was introduced into the attack. With KKR off to a stable start and looking to build momentum, Jadeja&#39;s over was nothing short of a masterstroke. Claiming two crucial wickets in a single over, he not only broke the backbone of KKR&#39;s batting lineup but also significantly shifted the momentum in favour of CSK. His ability to bowl with precision and exploit the pitch conditions underscored the strategic planning behind his introduction at that juncture of the game. Following Jadeja&#39;s lead, the rest of the CSK bowling unit tightened the screws on KKR. The bowlers, backed by astute field placements, gave nothing away, showcasing discipline and control. The pressure created led to KKR&#39;s middle order crumbling, unable to find the boundary with regularity, and consequently being restricted to a below-par total of 137. <strong>CSK&#39;s Chase: A Mix of Caution and Aggression.&nbsp;<\/strong>In pursuit of a modest target, CSK approached the chase with a blend of aggression and tactical acumen. Ruturaj Gaikwad, leading from the front, notched up a vital half-century, his first as the captain of CSK, playing a captain&#39;s knock when it mattered the most. His innings were a mix of caution and calculated aggression, setting the tone for the chase. Shivam Dube&#39;s cameo further accelerated the pace, ensuring that the required run rate was always within control. Dube&#39;s ability to strike lusty blows, coupled with Gaikwad&#39;s anchoring role, exemplified CSK&#39;s batting depth and their ability to pace the innings according to the match situation.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">Shreyas Iyer, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>Skipper:<\/span> <span style=\"color:#8e44ad\">&quot; &nbsp;It&#39;s deafening out here, but I&#39;ll try to express. We got a great start in the powerplay, but we lost consecutive wickets which tilted the momentum. We weren&#39;t able to assess the conditions quickly after the powerplay and thus scoring runs wasn&#39;t easy. They very well know the conditions and did pretty well to assess the same, they bowled according to their plans. It Wasn&#39;t easy for the new batters to go after the bowlers from the first ball. We were trying to construct the innings, but it didn&#39;t fall in place according to the plan and we fell short.

As for the ball I got out to, I was actually trying to play it a bit square, but I missed it.He&#39;s (Umesh Yadav) someone who&#39;s very experienced, and even Darshan, the way our bowlers bowled in this game, as I&#39;ve already mentioned, was tremendous to watch. They got off to a decent start, and to restrict them to around 160-165 runs was what we were hoping for.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">KL Rahul&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;We&#39;ll take the win, I am not going to make too much out of it. I think for the young bowling group that we have, it helps when we bat first and they get a bit of an idea of how the wicket&#39;s playing and they&#39;ve also been adapting really well. [On 100% record of defending 160+ total] Yeah, it&#39;s a good record to have, obviously. But I also think it&#39;s because of where we&#39;ve played and the conditions. Last time we played here in Lucknow, the wickets were very low-scoring, and it&#39;s a low-scoring ground. So, we defended quite well there. Having that home advantage obviously helps a little bit. And yes, I mean, the bowlers have come through the ranks in the last couple of years. You&#39;ve seen the same guys playing last season as well, and they&#39;ve adjusted to their roles. They&#39;re reading the wickets really well. That&#39;s something that I try to discuss with them a lot more off the field and even during practice.<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Player of The Match: Yash Thakur<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>I am happy for the first 5-wicket haul and first player of the match award.

Starting with the outfield, it&#39;s in pristine condition, allowing for ground shots instead of just lofted hits. The square boundaries measure 63 and 62 meters, while the straight boundary stretches to 74 meters, the longest here. Turning our attention to the pitch, I&#39;ve got Simon Katich with me. Simon, what&#39;s your take on the pitch?&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Katich: &quot;We&#39;re looking at pitch number seven today, and it&#39;s as hard as concrete. It&#39;s the same strip from the recent game against Rajasthan Royals, where Trent Boult showcased his swing bowling prowess. However, with today&#39;s hotter conditions, I&#39;m anticipating a high-scoring game. The pitch has a covering of grass, but it&#39;s really set up for the batsmen. Last year, we saw four centuries scored here, and many of Mumbai&#39;s batsmen relish playing at the Wankhede. Statistically, spinners have been more economical than pacers here and have a better average. But given the small dimensions of the ground, bowling spin comes with its own set of risks due to the likelihood of the ball sailing over the boundary.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Mbangwa: &quot;The decision at the toss is a tricky one, as historical data suggests chasing teams often have the upper hand.

Key performances from Romario Shepherd, Rohit Sharma, Ishan Kishan, Jasprit Bumrah, and Gerald Coetzee were instrumental in MI&#39;s win.

Prithvi Shaw&#39;s quick fifty provided some momentum, but Jasprit Bumrah&#39;s exceptional yorker cut his innings short. Tristan Stubbs offered a glimmer of hope with a rapid half-century, but the absence of a powerful hitter alongside him left DC struggling.

But all eyes are on the silent giants &ndash; Buttler and Jaiswal. A big knock from either could send shivers down RCB&#39;s spine.RCB, on the other hand, are desperate to turn things around. With a solitary win in four, their campaign is riddled with inconsistency, especially from their star-studded batting line-up.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nThis clash promises a fascinating battle between contrasting bowling attacks. However, RR&#39;s&nbsp; bowling mastery, currently the best in the IPL, could be RCB&#39;s lower order&#39;s undoing. The explosive Shimron Hetmyer, often used as a late-innings finisher by RR, could be the game-changer.

Previously, this pitch has seen scores around 180.

It&#39;s well-maintained, promising high-scoring affairs. Fast bowlers can look forward to some extra bounce with the new ball, yet it&#39;s not all challenging for the spinners. This surface, in particular, offers more turn, around 2.2 degrees, more than the usual 1.8 degrees on other pitches at this venue.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Dasgupta: &quot;WV points this out because upon close inspection, the grass is quite patchy. There are spots completely devoid of grass, and then there are grassy patches.&quot;<br \/>\nRaman: &quot;Indeed, and despite the dry patches, the spinners can be heartened by the bigger boundaries compared to other venues, giving them a unique advantage.&quot;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (56)_1712411869.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PLAYER BATTLES TO LOOK OUT FOR&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Virat Kohli <\/span>vs <span style=\"color:#990033\">Sandeep Sharma<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\">Jos Buttler<\/span> vs <span style=\"color:#000066\">Mohammed Siraj<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Glenn Maxwell<\/span> vs <span style=\"color:#990033\">Yuzvendra Chahal&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\"><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (95)_1712412321.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS UPDATE:&nbsp; <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#990033\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#990033\">Sanju Samson |&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RR-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;We&#39;ve decided to bowl first on this pitch.

Virat Kohli and Faf du Plessis unleashed a storm against RR, crafting a dazzling century partnership for the opening wicket until Chahal struck, providing the much-needed breakthrough for RR. Following this, RR tightened their bowling, ramping up the pressure on RCB.

Despite our efforts, hitting was difficult, with many shots not connecting as intended.<\/span><\/strong><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">Virat was in fine form, and with partners like Green or DK, we aimed to capitalize in the final overs, given our wicket reserve.

Narine&#39;s explosive cameo and Venkatesh Iyer&#39;s classy half-ton in their previous match? Pure gold!<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Now, as these Titans gear up for a clash that&#39;s got everyone on the edge of their seats, it&#39;s not just about the runs or the wickets; it&#39;s about making a statement. With DC&#39;s balanced attack squaring off against KKR&#39;s dynamite lineup, we&#39;re in for a cricketing spectacle loaded with nail-biting moments and heart-thumping action.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>So, strap in, folks. Whether you&#39;re Team Delhi, rooting for that strategic masterclass, or Team Kolkata, all about that unbeatable streak, one thing&#39;s for sure &ndash; this clash is going to light up the night sky.

The weather is pleasantly cool, making for a comfortable environment. This ground isn&#39;t the largest, which is evident from the boundary dimensions &ndash; 60 meters square on both sides. For a right-hander, behind me, the distance is even shorter at 53 meters, making it quite easy to notch up a few quick runs to that boundary. The deep third man stands at 59 meters. Given that KKR, known for their high six-hitting capabilities, is in town, we&#39;re in for a thrilling match.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Examining the pitch, it&#39;s extremely well-maintained and incredibly firm. The lack of live grass suggests that spinners might find it challenging to extract much deviation or manipulate the pace and line effectively.This element will definitely add an exciting dimension to tonight&#39;s game.The pitch appears to offer a balanced surface throughout. I&#39;m hopeful it will remain consistent, allowing the batsmen to execute a full range of shots.

The bowlers really stepped up during the Powerplay, and we came together well as a team. Our batting needs to pick up a bit too.

It&#39;s fantastic to see our bowlers stepping up when needed and making the most of their moments. Regarding the injury concern on the field, I can empathize; I&#39;ve been there.

With two losses in defensive stands and only one victory in a chase, the team faces the familiar scrutiny over its bowling capabilities. Ahead of their clash against the Lucknow Super Giants&mdash;a side that previously snatched a dramatic victory from their grasp&mdash;the challenge of overcoming the venue&#39;s inherent disadvantages looms large.Nicholas Pooran, pivotal in LSG&#39;s last-season win against RCB, steps up again amid speculation around KL Rahul&#39;s role due to fitness concerns. Boosted by a recent win against Punjab Kings and the spotlight on Mayank Yadav&#39;s pace prowess, LSG&#39;s confidence is high.RCB, on the other hand, pins hopes on its batting powerhouses like Faf du Plessis, Glenn Maxwell, and Rajat Patidar to make their mark. Amidst this, the bowling lineup seeks to reinforce its support for Virat Kohli, who is playing his 100th game in BengaluruLSG, similar to RCB in navigating early-season jitters, eyes continuity in victory. Both teams, poised at a crucial juncture, aim to shed their early inconsistencies. This confrontation at M.Chinnaswamy Stadium is not just a test of strategy and skill but also a momentous occasion marking Kohli&#39;s centenary of appearances, promising a duel rich in narratives and the potential for an epic showdown in IPL 2024&#39;s unfolding saga.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nPitch Report | Murali Kartik and Graeme Swann : <\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&quot;Pitch number 7, previously seen in the game against Punjab Kings where 175 was scored, now shows an average first innings score of 196 in recent years. Immediately noticeable is its dryness, suggesting significant spin potential, particularly for Glenn Maxwell. In the recent clash between RCB and PBKS, spinners from both disciplines found turn on this surface. This year, it&#39;s emerged as the IPL&#39;s top spinner-friendly venue. Maxwell, and other spinners, will likely target the dry, crack-laden areas outside the right-handers&#39; off-stump, resembling a riverbed with interspersed grass patches. This could introduce variable bounce and turn, making it an intriguing pitch for spin bowling.&quot;&nbsp; &nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (6)_1712066841.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><br \/>\n<br \/>\nHead-to-Head at Bengaluru<\/strong> &ndash;<strong> The single encounter between <span style=\"color:#c0392b\">RCB <\/span>and <span style=\"color:#000066\">LSG <\/span>at this venue saw the latter emerging victorious, setting the stage for a revenge saga this season.&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/double-bat.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:38px; width:68px\" title=\"\" \/><strong>&nbsp;AND<\/strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text-logo.png\" style=\"height:21px; width:80px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<strong> FORM IN IPL 2024<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; <strong><span style=\"color:#e74c3c\">L<\/span>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#2ecc71\"> W&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong> <span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>L<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG.png\" style=\"height:40px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#e74c3c\"><strong>L&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span> <span style=\"color:#2ecc71\"><strong>W&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/image (50)_1712066746.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<strong>TOSS : <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">WON THE TOSS AND ELECTED TO FIELD&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/cricket-ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Faf du Plessis: &quot;We&#39;ve decided to chase today.

His pace was impressive, but even more so was his control over lengths, especially with that extra pace. Our bowling in the powerplay wasn&#39;t up to mark, too many deliveries played to their strengths. Maxwell did a great job pulling us back into the game, and we managed to restrict them towards the end. However, when chasing, building partnerships is crucial, and we failed to do that. We need to show some strong character in our next games to chase down totals successfully.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#000066\">KL Rahul | <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/LSG-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Overall, it was a solid team performance. The pitch offered some help for the fast bowlers, making it slightly tricky. By the time their bowlers figured out the right lengths to bowl, we had already put up a competitive score. We opted not to target the yorkers immediately, considering the pressure at Chinnaswamy can be overwhelming, and focused instead on bowling the right lengths.Keeping to Mayank Yadav was an experience, especially with one delivery hitting me quite hard. It&rsquo;s been fantastic watching Mayank&#39;s growth, especially after his patience through injury and training in Bombay.Regarding our record while defending, despite the trend in T20 to bowl first, our history suggests batting first works well for us. My strategy of losing the toss seems to work in our favor (laughs).<br \/>\nWe don&rsquo;t see setbacks in a negative light; it&rsquo;s all about how we stay engaged in the game. If we&rsquo;re outplayed, then it&rsquo;s a different discussion, but making mistakes is part of the game since the opposition also aims to win. Our focus is on improving our powerplay bowling, which has been a concern. This game we opted for spin, which worked well against their lineup, and we&rsquo;ll continue to work on taking early wickets.&quot;<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n<strong>PLAYER OF THE MATCH : <span style=\"color:#000066\">MAYANK YADAV&nbsp;&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/clapping.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;<\/span><\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#000066\"><strong>Mayank Yadav: &quot;Winning the Player of the Match in two consecutive games feels great, but seeing my team win is even more satisfying.

Honestly, the early wickets were beyond our expectations, but their performances were exceptional.Our team is blessed with notable talents, yet it&#39;s the collective understanding of our role within the team that truly makes us stand out. Ashwin, for instance, adapting his bowling to the slowing pitch, exemplifies this perfectly, maintaining pressure during the crucial middle overs.There&#39;s a unique zeal within the squad to excel every IPL season.

Winning the toss and executing our plan set the tone, putting them under pressure right from the start. Facing Rohit, I always aim to mix it up; it&#39;s rewarding when the plan succeeds. Nandre Burger brings immense value with his confident South African bowling style, complementing our attack that includes consistent performers like Sandeep, Ashwin, and Chahal.

A pleasant breeze is sweeping across the field, and we&#39;re positioned on pitch number 4, perfectly centered. The boundaries measure 62m on either side of the wicket and extend to 71m down the ground. The pitch sports an even grass cover, and the robust root structure is holding the soil well, indicating limited turn. It looks like a fantastic pitch for batting. While the average first innings score from games prior to 2019 hovered around 157, it&#39;s a bit outdated. We anticipate the current average first innings score to be in the range of 175-180. Bowlers will need to be strategic in their approach, leaning towards back of a length deliveries, varying pace, and employing cutters effectively.

The pitch seems promising, and we aim to maximize it with our batting. Our goal is to post a solid total and then effectively defend it with our bowling. Practicing here has made a significant difference. We&#39;re making two adjustments to our lineup today. Kuldeep Yadav is dealing with a minor issue, so he&#39;s out, and Prithvi Shaw will be taking his place. Ishant Sharma will be stepping in for Ricky Bhui.

The spectacle of Dhoni&#39;s late onslaught, while thrilling, wasn&#39;t enough to bridge the gap for Chennai Super Kings. From the outset, Delhi Capitals executed their game plan with precision, maintaining control over the proceedings. The target of 192, initially seen as reachable given the favorable pitch conditions and shorter boundaries, became a daunting task under the spell of Khaleel Ahmed&#39;s remarkable opening spell. Ahmed&#39;s prowess not only led to the dismissal of CSK&#39;s crucial openers but also showcased his dominance over a talent like Rachin, highlighting the effectiveness of his attack.<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Throughout the game, Delhi Capitals balanced aggression with strategic play, setting a formidable score thanks, in part, to Rishabh Pant&#39;s aggressive half-century. Despite the magical moments provided by Dhoni, it was the collective effort and strategic execution by the Capitals that sealed the deal.

Considering their start at 60 for no loss, pulling them back to 190 felt like a solid effort. Throughout the game, the pitch seemed consistent, though Rachin appeared to struggle a bit with the spongy bounce. Our start wasn&#39;t ideal, and that gap became the critical difference. Initially, the target seemed achievable, but we soon faced significant seam movement and struggled to catch up, lacking those crucial big overs. Regarding Deepak, he&#39;s accustomed to bowling three overs upfront, although the last over in the powerplay turned out costly. After two wins, a setback in the third game isn&#39;t unexpected. Losing by 20 runs came down to just a few shots, and overall, our bowlers performed commendably.&quot;&nbsp;<\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Rishabh Pant, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/DC-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:31px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Today, our bowlers were spot on. We&#39;ve taken our previous lessons to heart. Shaw has been putting in the effort for the last two weeks, and giving him the opportunity paid off today. Mukesh&#39;s role, especially at the death, will vary from game to game. For me, cricket has always been my life, and giving my all is non-negotiable. After not playing much for 1.5 years, it took some time to adjust, but my self-belief has never wavered. It&#39;s crucial to keep coming back, no matter what.&quot;<br \/>\n<br \/>\nKhaleel Ahmed (Player of the Match): &quot;My performance today is the fruit of relentless hard work at the domestic level. I&#39;ve focused on enhancing my swing, and it&#39;s gratifying to see the outcomes. There&#39;s a unique joy in watching batters struggle against my swing. Of course, making a comeback to the Indian team remains my ultimate aim.

CSK&#39;s bowling unit then took centre stage, curtailing GT&#39;s chase to 143\/8.<\/p>\n\n<p>SRH, meanwhile, has been the talk of the tournament following their explosive performance against MI, where they racked up the highest-ever IPL team total of 277 runs.

Had a few goals, but can&#39;t help if injuries come in the way.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":11,"ProjectedScore":"178","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Mayank Yadav","MOM_TYPE":"Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"987","MOMRuns":"-","MOMBalls":"-","MOMWicket":"3","MOMRC":"27","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/amTBliCBsC1711262331987.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1363,"MatchTypeID":8,"MatchType":"T20 (N)","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-03-29","MatchDateNew":"29 Mar 2024","MatchName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru vs Kolkata Knight Riders","MatchTime":"19:30","GMTMatchTime":"14:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-03-29","FirstBattingTeamID":19,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru","SecondBattingTeamID":16,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Kolkata Knight Riders","FirstBattingTeamCode":"RCB","SecondBattingTeamCode":"KKR","GroundID":12,"GroundName":"M Chinnaswamy Stadium","Commentss":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won by 7  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Kolkata Knight Riders","TossDetails":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"182\/6 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"186\/3 (16.5 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-03-29 19:30:00","city":"Bengaluru","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"https:\/\/www.royalchallengers.com\/","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":261,"GroundUmpire2ID":44,"GroundUmpire3ID":352,"RefereeID":88,"HomeTeamID":"19","HomeTeamName":"Royal Challengers Bengaluru","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"16","AwayTeamName":"Kolkata Knight Riders","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"29 Mar 2024","MatchEndTime":"23:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":10,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Rohan Pandit","GroundUmpire2":"Anil Chaudhary","ThirdUmpire":"Bruce Oxenford","Comments":"Kolkata Knight Riders Won By 7  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/aFPMviEPyJ1710927747rcb.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/KKR.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/aFPMviEPyJ1710927747rcb.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/KKR.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2018-100mb00000000012-ea4c47d2e99b11","CurrentStrikerName":"Shreyas Iyer","StrikerRuns":39,"StrikerBalls":24,"StrikerFours":2,"StrikerSixes":2,"StrikerSR":162.5,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/1QBCWO2zhl171110625912.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000152-335aed3d44aa11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Rinku Singh","NonStrikerRuns":5,"NonStrikerBalls":5,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":100,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/La76P0ZzSW1711106362152.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2022-100mb00000001547-613ed5ea54ee11","CurrentBowlerName":"Mayank Dagar","BowlerOvers":"2.5","BowlerRuns":23,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":1,"BowlerEconomy":8.12,"BowlerSR":17,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/kyHFvTvYdV17110079641547.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"182\/6 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"182","1FallWickets":"6","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"9.1","2Summary":"186\/3 (16.5 Overs)","2FallScore":"186","2FallWickets":"3","2FallOvers":"16.5","2RunRate":"11.05","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"16","MatchOrder":"Match 10","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Welcome to the blockbuster showdown as Royal Challengers Bengaluru and Kolkata Knight Riders prepare for an electrifying clash in match number 10 of the Indian Premier League 2024 at the M Chinnaswamy Stadium.&nbsp;The host, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; steps into the arena with a win and a loss from their opening two encounters.

The square is a little bit used, but the outfield looks superb. The dimensions of the ground aren&#39;t huge. We are the centre of the square - 61 metres (square) on either side and 75 metres straight. A high six-hitting ground. In the first game played here, we saw a number of seam bowlers taking pace off the ball and using the slower option. Maybe that&#39;s something faster bowlers may go to today. It looks interesting. It&#39;s still a good wicket and if the spinners keep landing the ball well it can get you a little more turn.

Looking at the way we batted in the first innings it was tough due to the lack of pace.

Notably, since IPL 2013, MI has historically found themselves on the back foot in season openers.<\/p>\n\n<p>In their opening game, Jasprit Bumrah delivered an exceptional performance, with figures of 4-0-14-3, playing a crucial role in containing GT to a manageable total. Rohit Sharma, the stalwart Mumbaikar, contributed a fiery 43 off 29 balls, keeping MI&#39;s chase on track before his dismissal turned the tide of the game.

Both teams have won their respective openers, with CSK defeating their rival RCB, while GT overcame the five-time champions, Mumbai.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For CSK, Mustafizur Rahman delivered a fearsome spell in the first game, claiming four important wickets, including those of Kohli, Faf, Patidar, and Green, while Deepak Chahar accounted for the dangerous Maxwell. Rachin Ravindra had an impressive debut, going berserk against the opposition with a quickfire 37 off 15 balls, while his compatriot, Daryl Mitchell, also made a notable debut, scoring 22 off 18, including two sixes. The duo of Shivam Dube and Ravindra Jadeja provided a perfect finish to the game with a solid half-century partnership.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>For GT, Sai Sudharsan and Shubman Gill picked up where they left off, impressing the management with a flurry of runs, with the former scoring 45 and the latter adding an important 31. The pace department collectively secured 8 wickets, with all four bowlers&mdash;Umesh Yadav, Mohit Sharma, Spencer Johnson, and Azmatullah Omarzai&mdash;picking up two wickets each. The spin duo of Sai Kishore and Rashid Khan bowled economically in the middle overs, conceding only 47 runs in their eight overs and taking a wicket.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>Both teams will look to carry the winning momentum going ahead.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" \/> vs <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/GT-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:32px\" title=\"\" \/><strong> Head-to-Head:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>In the five games battled, <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">GT<\/span> won three games while <span style=\"color:#f39c12\">CSK<\/span> won two.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/14_1711458728.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Stats and Records at MA Chidambaram Stadium:&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>The Pacers have picked as many as 506 wickets in the 77 matches played at this venue while spinners have picked 331 wickets in as many games. 46 of the games have been won by teams defending while 31 games have been won by teams chasing.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Ground Dimensions:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (3)_1711459596.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>PITCH REPORT:<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>Matthew Hayden<\/strong>&nbsp;: &quot;It&#39;s a different track tonight.

The innings were marked by notable contributions from their lineup, particularly the left-handed duo Rachin Ravindra and Shivam Dube. Ravindra delivered a fiery 46 at a strike rate of 230, while Dube unleashed a barrage of hits, amassing 51 off just 23 balls. Tasked with a daunting target of 206, GT faced an uphill battle right from the onset, compounded by the early loss of their captain, Shubman Gill, during the powerplay. Deepak Chahar&#39;s initial breakthroughs, removing both openers, laid the groundwork for CSK&#39;s dominance in the subsequent overs. GT struggled to find their rhythm, with CSK&#39;s bowlers efficiently dismantling their batting lineup and ensuring wickets fell consistently. Ultimately, GT could not surmount the challenge, falling short by 63 runs, as CSK&#39;s fortress remained unbreached.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#2980b9\">Shubman Gill, GT Skipper:<\/span> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">&quot;They outplayed us in the second innings and their execution was spot on.

I think it&rsquo;s a great learning for the bowlers. I think it&rsquo;s better to have this kind of game early on in the tournament rather than in the latter stage.

In Chennai we are not sure how the wicket will be, we need to do well irrespective of batting or bowling first. Here if we have wickets in hand at the end it helps. Personally felt, that Rachin batted brilliantly in the powerplay and took the game away. From there we were always ahead. Shivam Dube is high on confidence, the management and Mahi bhai worked with him, and his confidence is very high. He knows his roles very well. Definitely he is a big plus for us.

The pitch is rock hard, there&#39;s a bit of grass on it and what we know about last year&#39;s IPL is the average first innings score is 196. The ball is going to fly everywhere. The trend in this IPL so far has been the home team winning. Can the RCB get off the mark tonight in front of their adoring fans? There are a few cracks but they look superficial and it also looks patchy with patches of grass. Maybe a little bit two-paced because it is dry where there are cracks but under lights you expect the ball to come on to the bat&quot;.&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/IPl Stats Temp 2024 (18)_1711375005.jpg\" style=\"width:640px\" \/><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong>TOSS:&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/scores.bcci.tv\/matchcentre\/commentaryFiles\/MicrosoftTeams-image - 2024-03-25T193843_1711375756.png\" style=\"width:640px\" \/>&nbsp;<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> <span style=\"color:#2980b9\">has won the toss and have elected to <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/ball.png\" style=\"height:23px; width:23px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp; first<\/span><\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#2980b9\"><strong>Faf du Plesis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> Skipper: &quot;We are going to have a bowl.

Yash Dayal&#39;s formidable powerplay overs, coupled with Siraj&#39;s adept run rate management, saw the duo surrender a mere 49 runs across their combined 8 overs while claiming three vital wickets. Shashank Singh&#39;s spirited charge towards the end propelled PBKS to a commendable 176.<\/p>\n\n<p>RCB&#39;s chase witnessed early setbacks, losing two wickets early on, yet Kohli, true to his moniker &#39;King Kohli,&#39; kept the scoreboard ticking, crafting a masterful 77 off 49 balls.

It was then that DK stepped up, epitomizing the adage &quot;cometh the hour, cometh the man,&quot; alongside Mahipal Lomror, who unleashed a flurry of shots. Lomror&#39;s rapid 17 off 8 and DK&#39;s explosive 28 at an astounding strike rate of 280 ushered RCB to victory with four balls to spare, illustrating the dynamic, unpredictable nature of cricket where heroes emerge in the face of adversity.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><strong><span style=\"color:#c0392b\">Shikhar Dhawan, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/PK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:54px\" title=\"\" \/> Skipper: &quot; &nbsp;It was a decent game, we came back and again lost it.

Gujarat Titans&#39; opening duo, Wriddhiman Saha and Shubman Gill, got off to a swift start.&nbsp;Gill contributed 31 from 22 deliveries, B Sai Sudharsan compiled 45 from 39, and Azmatullah Omarzai&#39;s brief appearance yielded 17 runs off 11 balls. Bumrah&#39;s tight bowling was the highlight, ending the figures of 4-0-14-3. Rahul Tewatia&#39;s quick 22 off 15 helped set GT&#39;s score at 168\/6 by the end of their innings. Omarzai early on rattled MI with the dismissal of Ishan Kishan for a duck and later Naman Dhir, who had started aggressively with 20 runs from 10 balls. Rohit Sharma and Dewald Brevis stitched together a promising 77-run partnership, seemingly steering Mumbai towards a comfortable chase during the mid-overs. However, Sai Kishore, managed to dismiss Rohit for 43 off 29 balls, signaling a shift in momentum. As the match progressed, GT&#39;s bowlers excellently exploited the conditions, elevating the required run rate and putting pressure on the Mumbai lineup, which faltered despite having power hitters like Tim David and Pandya. Mohit Sharma&#39;s spell of 4-0-32-2 and Spencer Johnson&#39;s crucial 19th over, where he claimed two vital wickets, underscored a remarkable turnaround by the Titans just as MI appeared in control of their chase. Needing 19 runs off the last over, Pandya&#39;s initial boundaries brought hope, narrowing it down to 9 required from 4 balls.

Despite these challenges, their batsmen lit up the powerplays, marking themselves as the most aggressive starters, a stark contrast to LSG&#39;s more measured approach, which ranked them among the slowest. Looking ahead to IPL 2024, both Rajasthan Royals and Lucknow Super Giants maintain their squad cores without major overhauls. Royals&#39; strategy revolves around the formidable Jos Buttler, while LSG will lean on KL Rahul&#39;s prowess, with Devdutt Padikkal potentially leading their charge as the opener. The spin duo of Ravi Ashwin and Yuzvendra Chahal for Rajasthan, and Naveen-ul-Haq with Ravi Bishnoi for Lucknow, are set to headline their respective bowling attacks.

Riyan Parag then took charge, contributing a valuable 43 to the innings. The partnership between Samson and Parag laid the foundation for RR&#39;s substantial total. Samson&#39;s innings, coupled with Dhruv Jurel&#39;s quickfire cameo, propelled RR to 193\/4. On the LSG front, Naveen-ul-Haq emerged as the lead bowler, claiming two crucial wickets. LSG initially lost 3 wickets in the powerplay and was put on the backfoot. KL held one end and Hooda provided the acceleration! As the chase intensified, LSG found themselves in a crunch situation, needing 49 runs off the final 24 deliveries. It was Sharma&#39;s crucial over, culminating in Rahul&#39;s wicket, that tipped the scales. Despite Rahul&#39;s patient 58 and Pooran&#39;s more aggressive 64* off 41, their efforts fell short. Initially, RR seemed to lose grip after reducing LSG to a precarious position, but Sharma, with his 1 for 22 in three overs, was precisely what RR needed. Their tight bowling restricted LSG, sealing a pivotal win for the home side.<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#ff0066\"><strong>Sanju Samson, RR Skipper and Player of the Match:<\/strong><\/span> <span style=\"color:#ff0066\">&quot;Always great to spend time in the middle and it becomes more special when you win the game.

Neither team managed to secure a spot in the playoffs in the previous season.&nbsp;<br \/>\nThis year, both teams will be steered by new captains, bringing a fresh perspective to the field. Shreyas Iyer makes his much-anticipated return to KKR, ready to lead the team with renewed vigour after a year&#39;s absence. Meanwhile, Pat Cummins, known for his cool and composed demeanor, takes the helm of SRH following a series of global cricketing successes. The inclusion of Travis Head and Wanindu Hasaranga, alongside the trade for Shahbaz Ahmed, positions SRH as one of the most well-rounded teams in the competition. With Marco Jansen and Aiden Markram also key figures, SRH is looking forward to initiating their campaign on a triumphant note.<br \/>\nOn the other side, KKR is eager to make a strong start under the leadership of Shreyas Iyer, who is back to infuse dynamism and strategic prowess into the team. The acquisition of Mitchell Starc represents a significant investment, adding a layer of rich experience to the squad. The team also welcomed Dushmantha Chameera as a replacement for the injured Atkinson, and Phill Salt steps in for Jason Roy, who opted out of the IPL to manage his workload.

However, KKR&#39;s spinners, led by Sunil Narine, tightened the screws in the middle overs, making the chase increasingly arduous. Klaasen&#39;s late surge, scoring a fiery 63 in 29, brought SRH tantalizingly close, but Rana&#39;s cool final over, defending 13 runs, clinched the thriller for KKR.This electrifying clash wasn&#39;t just a game; it was a testament to KKR&#39;s resilience and strategic brilliance, echoing the golden era of 2014 with Gambhir&#39;s spirit felt in the dugout and Russell and Narine turning back the clock with their match-winning performances. As KKR embarks on their campaign with a nail-biting victory, the echoes of Eden Gardens&#39; roars remind us of the magic of cricket and the fine margins that define it.&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#d35400\"><strong>Pat Cummins <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/SRH-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper : &quot;It was a nail-biter, truly a fantastic display of cricket. Sadly, it didn&rsquo;t swing in our favor. I&rsquo;m largely pleased with our bowling effort through the game. Andre Russell, in the closing stages, did what he&rsquo;s known for, proving to be a formidable challenge to contain. On the whole, I believe we managed quite well. Despite the planning and execution, facing someone like Dre Russ is always a tough call. He played some exceptional shots, though there were a few deliveries we possibly could have executed differently. Bowling to a powerhouse like him in the final overs is arguably the most challenging task in cricket. It can go either way, but it was remarkable how Klaas (Klaasen) and Shahbaz brought us back into contention and nearly across the line. It was unexpected yet impressive to get that close. Competing against such a strong team, especially at their home ground, is commendable. There&#39;s a lot from this game that&rsquo;s encouraging, alongside standout performances, but also a few aspects we need to tweak. I&rsquo;m content with how the coin toss turned out.&quot;&nbsp;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Shreyas Iyer&nbsp;<img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/KKR-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/>&nbsp;Skipper: &quot;Heading into the 17th over, my stomach was in knots, sensing the game could swing any way in the final moments. With 13 runs needed and a less experienced bowler at the helm, the pressure was palpable. Yet, my belief in him was unwavering. I reassured him, urging him to have faith in his abilities, emphasizing that the outcome was secondary. He seemed anxious, but I made it a point to look him straight in the eyes and remind him, &#39;this is your moment, buddy.&#39; Encouraging him to trust in his skills, regardless of the game&#39;s direction. Their team&#39;s experience is formidable. Watching Andre excel with both bat and ball, along with Sunny&#39;s exceptional performance with the ball, was heartening. Having such talent in the team not only motivates but also brings a wealth of knowledge. Kicking off with a victory always boosts morale. Nevertheless, this match has been a learning curve, offering insights we&#39;re keen to carry forward. Fielding, in particular, is one aspect we&#39;re looking to bolster.&quot;&nbsp;<\/strong><\/span><br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<br \/>\n<span style=\"color:#8e44ad\"><strong>Andre Russell | Player of the Match: Honestly, it&#39;s not often that I pay attention, but occasionally, I&#39;ll notice highlights on my Instagram and realize just how well I&#39;ve been hitting the ball. It&#39;s a nice reminder that things are going well. I&#39;ve had to adapt to whatever&#39;s thrown my way, especially in the past couple of years, as bowlers craft specific plans against me. Despite that, I&#39;ve managed to score runs, fully aware that every opponent has a strategy for me. Reflecting on my time with KKR, I started off on the sidelines, but I always aimed to contribute meaningfully. This team holds a special place in my heart, and what I achieved tonight is a testament to the significance of wearing this jersey. I&#39;m hopeful to continue delivering performances like this. Speaking of Harshit Rana, his actions speak volumes about his character. He was adamant about bowling the final over, took the responsibility upon himself, and remarkably bounced back after the first delivery was hit for a six.<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p><br \/>\n&nbsp;<\/p>\n","MatchRow":3,"ProjectedScore":"204","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Andre Russell","MOM_TYPE":"Batting\/Bowling","MOMPlayerId":"141","MOMRuns":"64","MOMBalls":"25","MOMWicket":"2","MOMRC":"25","MOMImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/k9HNNNr5UH1711106337141.png","KO":""},{"CompetitionID":148,"MatchID":1355,"MatchTypeID":5,"MatchType":"T20 D\/N","MatchStatus":"Post","MatchDate":"2024-03-23","MatchDateNew":"23 Mar 2024","MatchName":"Punjab Kings vs Delhi Capitals","MatchTime":"15:30","GMTMatchTime":"10:00 GMT","GMTMatchDate":"2024-03-23","FirstBattingTeamID":14,"FirstBattingTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","SecondBattingTeamID":15,"SecondBattingTeamName":"Punjab Kings","FirstBattingTeamCode":"DC","SecondBattingTeamCode":"PBKS","GroundID":131,"GroundName":"PCA New Stadium","Commentss":"Punjab Kings Won by 4  Wickets ","TossTeam":"Punjab Kings","TossDetails":"Punjab Kings Won The Toss And Elected To Field","TossText":" Won The Toss And Elected To Field","Flag":1,"FirstBattingSummary":"174\/9 (20.0 Ov)","SecondBattingSummary":"177\/6 (19.2 Ov)","ClientMatchID":"","MATCH_COMMENCE_START_DATE":"2024-03-23 15:30:00","city":"Mullanpur","FlickrAlbumID":"","LiveStream":"","FBURL":"","T20ProMatchID":"","Temperature":"","WeatherIcon":"","TempUpdatedDate":"","GroundUmpire1ID":221,"GroundUmpire2ID":95,"GroundUmpire3ID":61,"RefereeID":87,"HomeTeamID":"15","HomeTeamName":"Punjab Kings","HomeTeamColor1":"#319490","HomeTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamColor1":"#319490","AwayTeamColor2":"#df7317","AwayTeamID":"14","AwayTeamName":"Delhi Capitals","timezone1":"Asia\/Kolkata","MatchEndDate":"23 Mar 2024","MatchEndTime":"19:30","MATCH_NO_OF_OVERS":"20","ROUND_ID":"26","MatchTypeName":"T20","RowNo":2,"TeamType":null,"CompetitionName":"Tata Ipl 2024","GroundUmpire1":"Madanagopal Jayaraman","GroundUmpire2":"Nikhil Patwardhan","ThirdUmpire":"Alex Wharf","Comments":"Punjab Kings Won By 4  Wickets ","HomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","AwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","MatchHomeTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/PBKS.png","MatchAwayTeamLogo":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/teamlogos\/DC.png","VideoScorecard":0,"TimeZone":"+9.5","CurrentStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000183-f4a991db44b611","CurrentStrikerName":"Liam Livingstone","StrikerRuns":38,"StrikerBalls":21,"StrikerFours":2,"StrikerSixes":3,"StrikerSR":180.95,"StrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/pUwFBE2gZx1711170298183.png","CurrentNonStrikerID":"2019-100mb00000000130-89338eb7449a11","CurrentNonStrikerName":"Harpreet Brar","NonStrikerRuns":2,"NonStrikerBalls":2,"NonStrikerFours":0,"NonStrikerSixes":0,"NonStrikerSR":100,"NonStrikerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/Cmg9oXuZj31711170126130.png","CurrentBowlerID":"2022-100mb00000001535-6fd8867c54e911","CurrentBowlerName":"Sumit Kumar","BowlerOvers":"1.2","BowlerRuns":19,"BowlerMaidens":0,"BowlerWickets":0,"BowlerEconomy":14.25,"BowlerSR":0,"BowlerImage":"https:\/\/scores.iplt20.com\/ipl\/playerimages\/b99QXAsodH17111719201535.png","ChasingText":"","MatchBreakComments":"","MatchProgress":"98.33","CurrentInnings":"2","1Summary":"174\/9 (20.0 Overs)","1FallScore":"174","1FallWickets":"9","1FallOvers":"20.0","1RunRate":"8.7","2Summary":"177\/6 (19.2 Overs)","2FallScore":"177","2FallWickets":"6","2FallOvers":"19.2","2RunRate":"9.16","3Summary":"","3FallScore":"","3FallWickets":"","3FallOvers":"","3RunRate":"","4Summary":"","4FallScore":"","4FallWickets":"","4FallOvers":"","4RunRate":"","5Summary":"","5FallScore":"","5FallWickets":"","5FallOvers":"","5RunRate":"","6Summary":"","6FallScore":"","6FallWickets":"","6FallOvers":"","6RunRate":"","DivisionID":"6","SecondInningsFirstBattingID":null,"SecondInningsFirstBattingName":"","SecondInningsSecondBattingID":null,"SecondInningsSecondBattingName":"","ThirdInningsFirstBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsFirstBattingName":"","ThirdInningsSecondBattingID":null,"ThirdInningsSecondBattingName":"","WinningTeamID":"15","MatchOrder":"Match 2","RevisedOver":"","RevisedTarget":"","PreMatchCommentary":"<p><strong>Punjab Kings and Delhi Capitals will start their campaign facing each other in match number 2 of the Indian Premier League 2024 at the Maharaja Yadavindra Singh International Cricket Stadium in Mullanpur, Chandigarh.

The presence of Pant will set the balance of Delhi in the batting department, while they have invested a huge price for the young sensation, Kumar Kushagra, who showed promise in the domestic circuits. Australian Captain Mitchell Marsh and Axar Patel are their key all-rounders, while Anrich Nortje will spearhead their pace bowling attack, and David Warner will be the key prospect with the bat, given the huge amount of experience he has got. The new-look Delhi will be keen to start their campaign on a high.Punjab Kings, on the other hand, led by Shikhar Dhawan, will be finding their combinations right this season. The trio of Rabada, Sam Curran, and Arshdeep Singh form the base of their bowling attack, while the addition of Harshal Patel has strengthened their bowling unit, providing a variety of options in the death. In the batting department, they have invested a good price in Rilee Rossouw, who will combine with Dhawan and Livingstone, forming a strong batting core. Jonny Bairstow is set to return to the squad to provide depth in the batting, along with the finisher, Jitesh Sharma.

However, this season, they&#39;ll be without key players Devon Conway and Matheesha Pathirana, who were instrumental in their success, as well as Ambati Rayudu, who will be missed following his retirement. Despite these absences, CSK has refreshed its squad with promising talents such as Sameer Rizvi and Aravelley Avanish, who have shown remarkable performance in local circuits recently. The inclusion of potent players like Daryl Mitchell and Rachin Ravindra adds a dynamic edge to the team, making CSK a well-balanced mix of experience and youthful exuberance.&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>On the other hand, Royal Challengers Bengaluru is looking to bounce back from a rather ordinary season last year, finishing in sixth place with an equal number of wins and losses. Their performance heavily relied on the batting prowess of Virat Kohli, Faf du Plessis, and Glenn Maxwell, while their bowling lineup struggled to make an impact. To revamp their bowling attack, RCB released Harshal Patel, Wanindu Hasaranga, and Josh Hazlewood, bringing in Alzarri Joseph, Lockie Ferguson, and Yash Dayal.

First time back here, great to see the Chennai fans again but I&#39;m here with RCB and hopefully we can turn over a very good CSK team. Prep has been good, we need to turn up now. Andy Flower is a seasoned campaigner, brings that experience. Our bowling resources fit well. Got more backup. Hopefully, injuires don&#39;t concern us much.

But I want to try and be in my shoes, not fill MSD&#39;s shoes. I got to know last week, but Mahi bhai hinted at it last year. Everyone is experienced here, sadly we are missing Conway and Pathirana. We&#39;ve got Rachin and Mitchell coming in though this year so they should fit in well. Four overseas - Mitchell, Rachin, Fizz and Theekshana.

Although it may not have been the suspenseful drama that some had anticipated, this major competition is off to a great start. RCB performed admirably earlier, posting 173 after struggling at 78\/5. Courtesy of Mustafizur Rahman who bagged 4 wickets on his CSK Debut. Although it was a respectable score and RCB would have realized that they needed to bowl well because the surface became slightly more favorable for batting under lights. The opening pair for CSK were off to a flying start, with Rachin making a memorable debut with a 15-ball 37. RCB somewhat recovered during the middle overs. But the onslaught from Dube and Jadeja gave no chance to RCB bowlers to stage a comeback during the death overs.&nbsp;<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Mustafizur Rahman is Player of the Match<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#c0392b\"><strong>Faf du Plesis, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/RCB-text.png\" style=\"height:18px; width:40px\" title=\"\" \/> Skipper: &quot; Always when you play, you get a bit of dip after the powerplay. Chennai is a very good team in the middle overs, they squeeze you with their spinners. Maybe we were about 15-20 runs short, the pitch wasn&rsquo;t as bad as we played in the first 10 overs. They were always ahead in the chase, we tried to squeeze and get a couple of wickets, but in the end, we didn&rsquo;t have enough runs on the board. On this pitch, it is always better to bat first. Last year, the record leans towards teams that batted first. The ball started to grip a bit with our spinners. Good for DK to set up his season, especially for someone who hasn&rsquo;t played a lot of cricket. Anuj Rawat has shown some great promise for us, he showed great composure for a young guy and great power through the backend.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n\n<p>&nbsp;<\/p>\n\n<p><span style=\"color:#f39c12\"><strong>Ruturaj Gaikwad, <img alt=\"\" src=\"https:\/\/bcci-stats-sports-mechanic.s3.amazonaws.com\/matchcentre\/images\/commentary\/smiley\/CSK-text.png\" style=\"height:20px; width:43px\" title=\"\" \/> Skipper: &quot; Total control I would say, right from the start apart from two-three overs in the middle over phase. Would&rsquo;ve loved 10-15 runs less but I think they played well towards the end to get to that score. I feel that was a big turning point to get Maxwell and Faf out. We got three quick wickets and it helped us control the next overs, that was the real turning point. I&rsquo;ve always enjoyed it captaincy, but never felt it as an additional pressure. Role clarity helps. Couple of things to work on, everyone batted well but I think if someone from the top 3 batted till the 15th over it would&rsquo;ve been even easier.&quot;<\/strong><\/span><\/p>\n","MatchRow":1,"ProjectedScore":"188","2ndProjectedScore":"0","3rdProjectedScore":"0","MOM":"Mustafizur
